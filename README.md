# Guess the Number
An improved version of my Number Guessing Game this time written in C#.

The player chooses a difficulty (easy, medium, hard and 'hit and hope' mode) and guesses a number between 1-50 with a response given of higher or lower to assist selecting the correct number.

I have added the ability to replay the game with error handling for invalid responses.
